## Contributing

## Contributing to Soundcheck
 
* Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't requested it
  and/or contributed it
* Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been implemented
  or the bug hasn't been fixed yet
* Fork the project
* Start a feature/bugfix branch
* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution
* Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Please try not to mess with the Rakefile, version, or history. If you want to
  have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is fine, but please
  isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around it.
